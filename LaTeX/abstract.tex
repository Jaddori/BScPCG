In this work, we have researched the applications of Perlin noise on procedural content generation in the context of cities. An example of a generation process is outlined. The work starts with a motivation for the research, followed by a description of the generation process and its implementation. The viability of this generation process was tested in a user study, the results of which have been analyzed and presented.
